diskover is an open source file system indexer that uses Elasticsearch to index and manage data across heterogeneous storage systems. Using diskover, you are able to more effectively search and organize files and system administrators are able to manage storage infrastructure, efficiently provision storage, monitor and report on storage use, and effectively make decisions about new infrastructure purchases.

As the amount of file data generated by businesses continues to expand, the stress on expensive storage infrastructure, users and system administrators, and IT budgets continues to grow.

Using diskover, users can identify old and unused files and give better insights into data change, file duplication and wasted space. diskover supports crawling local file-systems, crawling NFS/SMB, cloud storage, etc. Plugins can be used for adding additional meta data.

diskover runs on Linux, macOS and Windows 10 using Python 3.
