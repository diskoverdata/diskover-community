Diskover is an open source file system indexer that uses Elasticsearch to index and manage data across heterogeneous storage systems. Using Diskover, you can effectively search and organize files, and system administrators can manage storage infrastructure, efficiently provision storage, monitor and report on storage usage, and effectively make decisions about new infrastructure purchases.

As the amount of file data generated by businesses continues to expand, the stress on expensive storage infrastructure, users, system administrators, and IT budgets continues to grow.

Using Diskover, users can identify old and unused files and give better insights into data change, file duplication and wasted space. Diskover supports crawling local file systems, crawling NFS/SMB, cloud storage, etc. Plugins can be used for adding additional metadata.

Diskover runs on Linux, macOS and Windows 10 and is written in Python. Diskover's web app, diskover-web, is written in PHP, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.

The Diskover Community Edition is free to use for an unlimited timeâ€”no license keys required. It is the perfect solution for home use, and try out Diskover, and start understanding your data. Diskover also offers [annual solutions](https://diskoverdata.com/solutions/) for corporations, unlocking powerful additional core and industry-specific features.
