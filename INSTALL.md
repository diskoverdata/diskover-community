        * This copy command may differ depending on your PHP8 install directory location
        * If this does not work, the below commands can be used to find the files that you need to copy

find / -mount -name php.ini-production

listen = /var/opt/remi/php84/run/php-fpm/www.sock   (take note of this .sock location, you will need it later)
listen.owner = nginx                                (change user from 'nobody' and uncomment) 
listen.group = nginx                                (change user from 'nobody' and uncomment)

```

üî¥ PHP Directories Ownership:

```sh
chown -R root:nginx /var/opt/remi/php84/lib/php     (this command may differ depending on your PHP8 install directory)
mkdir /var/run/php-fpm
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/run/php-fpm
```

üî¥ Create SystemD Service File:
```
vi /etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service
```

üî¥ *Add the following to the file and save it*:

chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable php-fpm
systemctl start php-fpm
systemctl status php-fpm
```

## Python Installation

Diskover Community Edition v2.3 requires at a minimum Python3.8 to be installed on the system. You can validate the Python3 version that was installed on your OS by default by running : `python3 -V` -- If this returns a version equal to or higher than 3.8, you can skip this section!

üî¥ Install Python v3.12:

```
yum -y install python3.12 python3.12-devel gcc
```

üî¥ Configure Python v3.12 for Usage - *There are a couple of options here*:

- Call Python3.12 directly from Diskover and do nothing to the system level Python3 executable (Recommended).
- Symlink Python3.12 in as the default Python3 executable on your OS.

### Diskover Python Executable

Using this approach we will simply execute Diskover with the full path to our Python3.12 version : `/usr/bin/python3.12`

When we do a scan at the end of this install, we will use that full path instead of just `python3`

### Symlink

```sh
unlink /usr/bin/python3
ln -s /usr/bin/python3.12 /usr/bin/python3
which python3
python3 -V
```

The output of your `python3 -V` command should show a 3.12.X

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING!** Depending on your distributtion and version of Linux, modifying the system level Python3 executable version could have unintended consequences.

## Diskover Installation

Now that we've settled all the requirements to run the Diskover Community Edition, let's put the actual software in place. You'll want to get the code from this repository on the server you've been working on. Either by cloning this Git Repo directly on the server or pulling from our [Releases](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/releases) page!

üî¥ Uncompress the TAR:

```
tar -xvzf diskover-community-2.3.0.tar.gz
```

üî¥ Move the Source Code:

```sh
cd diskover-community-2.3.0/
cp -a diskover /opt/
cp -a diskover-web /var/www/
```

üî¥ Install the Python Libraries:

```sh
/usr/bin/python3.12 -m ensurepip
/usr/bin/python3.12 -m pip install -r /opt/diskover/requirements.txt
```

üî¥ Copy the Diskover-Web Nginx Configuration:

```sh
mv /var/www/diskover-web/diskover-web.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/
systemctl restart nginx php-fpm
systemctl status nginx php-fpm
chown -R nginx.nginx /var/www/diskover-web/
```

‚úèÔ∏è **NOTE!** You should now be able to hit your Diskover system at the IP address in the browser : `http://IP:8000` if this does not work initially and you get a 500 error, re-run that `chown` command above!

## Execute a Scan Task

We have installed all of the necessary components for Diskover Community Edition. 

üî¥ Let's run a scan of a folder on our local system and ensure things are working properly:

```
/usr/bin/python3.12 /opt/diskover/diskover.py -i diskover-test /opt/diskover
```

üî¥ Now that your scan has completed.. Let's view the contents! 

- Go Back to Diskover Web `http://IP:8000`
- Click the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** Icon in the Top-Right Corner
- Choose **Indices**
- Select the `diskover-test` Index and Choose `Save Selection`
- Click the **Dashboard** or **üìÅ File Search** Icon in the Top-Left Corner

You've now successfully installed the Diskover Community Edition v2.3.X!
